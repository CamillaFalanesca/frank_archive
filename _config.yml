description: Frank’s archive offers a glimpse into the life of a young American man in the early-twentieth century. Frank Westerman’s story emerged from a series of correspondences between members of the Westerman family including Frank’s then wife, Elsie Westerman (née Weiffenbach). Frank was born to Robert and Harriett Westerman on 26 October 1884. He was a resident of King County, Washington. He married Elsie Elizabeth Weiffenbach in 1912. Frank was drafted for war in 1918, over a year after the US formally entered World War 1. He died shortly after being drafted, at the age of 34 on 18 April 1919. His cause of death is unclear. Frank was buried in Lake View Cemetery, in Seattle. His gravesite reveals he was a Freemason. As for Elsie, she went on to remarry, was widowed twice and died in 1970.  Frank’s archive is part of a larger collection of postcards from Europe and the United States of America, in the period between 1900 and 1954.
